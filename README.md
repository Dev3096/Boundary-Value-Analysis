** BOUNDARY VALUE ANALYSIS ** 

Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) is a software testing technique used to identify errors and defects at the boundaries of input or output conditions. 
It focuses on testing the values that lie at the edges or boundaries of input domains, as these values are more likely to cause issues.

The principle behind BVA is that errors often occur at the boundaries due to the way the software handles these values. 
By testing the boundary values, we can uncover defects related to input validation, data range checking, and other boundary-related issues.

BVA involves selecting test cases that represent the minimum, maximum, and just beyond the boundaries of valid input ranges. 
It typically involves three categories of values:

1. Valid Boundary Values: These are the values at the lower and upper boundaries of the input domain. 
   For example, if an input field accepts values between 1 and 100, valid boundary values would be 1 and 100.

2. Invalid Boundary Values: These are values just outside the valid input range. 
   For example, if the valid input range is 1 to 100, invalid boundary values would be 0 and 101.

3. Special or Extreme Boundary Values: These are values that may cause different behavior in the software.
   They are typically the minimum or maximum possible values for a given input field.
   For example, if an input field accepts numbers up to 100, an extreme boundary value could be a very large number like 10^9.

By testing these boundary values, we can uncover defects such as off-by-one errors, incorrect handling of minimum and maximum values, truncation issues, and other boundary-related problems.

Boundary Value Analysis helps improve the efficiency and effectiveness of testing by focusing on critical areas where defects are more likely to occur. 
It complements other testing techniques and provides insights into the behavior of the software at the edges of its operational limits.

Overall, Boundary Value Analysis is a valuable technique to enhance test coverage and identify potential issues related to input boundaries in software applications.
